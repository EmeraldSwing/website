An admirer of 'bop style' of music and dance, Erol's understanding shifted over the years, towards respecting and understanding the culture and history. Researching into bebop/bop dancing for the past few years, he choreographed several 'bop-influenced' performances. Being a part of the local community, he tries to re-shape the approach towards jazz dancing. He shares his free perspective about technique and style, focusing on ways to approach improvisation.

## Maria Margot
The daughter of two dancers, Mar√≠a has been dancing practically all her life. She practiced ballet and other classical dance disciplines from an early age. She started dancing Lindy Hop in October 2013, thanks to the recommendation of a friend who knew she was passionate about jazz music. Since then, her education as a Lindy Hop dancer has been combined with the learning of other contemporary dances, such as blues, authentic jazz and tap, as well as more contemporary afro dances, such as hip hop and afroabeats.

Her passion for this dance led to an interest in understanding the social issues involved, an interest that manifested itself in the development of a PhD research. Specifically, her thesis studies the representation of the African-American body in Hollywood musical cinema of the 1930s, focusing on the phenomenon of musical blackface.
