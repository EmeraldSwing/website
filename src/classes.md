| | *"Freeing Improvisation"*  | *"Communication Makes Every Dance Better"* | *"Brush Up Your Basics, Start Shuffling Now: Pure Bal"*  
| **10:00 - 11:00 AM** | Working on being more relaxed with improvising. Less thinking, having a flow. Moving with the music. Not getting stuck with what we know | We will work on the basis of any partner dance and specifically the lindy hop: communication with our partner. We will talk about the lead-follow connection, the importance of each role, and the forms of individual expression within the couple. | Building more comfortable basics and adding some sparkly styling to help your pure bal basic stand out.

| | *"Freeing Improvisation and Rhythm II"*  | *"The Magic of the Swing out"* | *"Twist and Turn: Playful Toss Outs"*  
| **11:30 - 12:30 AM** | Weâ€™ll focus on the same aspect but add practises to improvise on rhythms as well. Calling or responding. | The swing out is in many ways what summarises lindy hop. We will try different energies, shapes and ways to get in and out of it. It can vary depending on different music, partners, dancefloors, individual variations, entrances or exits. Join us for a dive into the world of the swingout. Is there a perfect swing out? | Exciting toss out variations that feel smooth and easy. Prerequisites: Must know pure Balboa basic, lollies, toss outs.

| | *"Relaxed Charleston"*  | *"Jams and Competitions"* | *"Balboa Legacies: Moves from Original Dancers"*  
| **13:30 - 14:30 PM** | Staying relaxed and controlled during charleston steps. Getting influenced by classic routines. Discovering ways to get creative with kicks.  | "Competitive interaction" has driven the development of African American culture (Malone, 1996). We will focus on two performative aspects of the lindy hop: competitions and jam circles. We consider these places not only occasions to show off your skills. Rather, they are opportunities to offer your dancing self to your partner and those around you. Less of what and more of how. | Classic moves and stylings from the original dancers that everyone should know. Prerequisites: Must know pure Balboa basic, lollies, toss outs

| | *"Uncommon Steps from Legends"*  | *"How to Love the Closed Position"* | *"Dean and Jewel Lindy"*  
| **15:00 - 16:00 PM** | Some sick steps from Cab Calloway, Bunny Briggs and Marie Bryant. | We will explore the closed position. It may be uncommon at times in lindy hop. We will focus on ways to get into this position, the different postures our body can adopt and the movements we can create without breaking it. Make it comfortable, playful and enjoyable. | Learn the signature Lindy Hop style of Dean Collins and Jewel McGowan, focusing on their distinct style of swing out, and some of their signature moves and stylings. Prerequisite: Must be able to swing out at a variety of tempos
