## Classes
In 2022, we shifted to an open class track without levels for The Emerald Interlude. This time, we don't have tracks at all - you have eight hours of classes to choose from between twenty-four different options. Each class will last one hour, and video recaps will be provided to you through e-mail after the event.

When registering for the event through [jitter.dance](https://jitter.dance/events/64de537e45078a3dfd1a7fbf), you will not be asked for a role when selecting a partnered class. This is a limitation of the registration system: teachers are aware of this and know how many people will be in each class, and adjust accordingly (Such as frequent rotations in the case of imbalances).

Each set of teachers will stay in one venue each, so if you take a liking to their set of classes, you will not need to travel much! Erol will be based in [St Kevin's Community Centre](https://goo.gl/maps/6eqUigbpCgbXoHCH9), Maria & Johan will be in the [Charlemont Community Resource Center](https://goo.gl/maps/7E5H43C6bFySdxDv8), and Lauren & Peter will be in [Dublin Studio](https://goo.gl/maps/rxi2trFkX5zAx4dn6).
