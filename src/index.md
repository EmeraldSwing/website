Registration is now open for the 2023 edition of Emerald Swing! We are gradually refining how we present information, but here's the most pertinent details:

* The dates are October 20th-22nd
* The first activity is at 7PM on Friday, last class at 4PM on Sunday (Whiskey tasting ends around 7PM!)
* There is an early bird price available until the 22nd of September
* It's unlikely there will be single night passes due to venue capacity - determined after early bird
* You'll have eight hours of core classes, choosing between 24 options
* There'll be six hours of social dancing across two nights - we're trying to negotiate for two more hours
* Each night of social dancing will feature an hour taster class, a live band, and a special competition

Your teachers are as follows:

* Erol Akinci (Turkey) teaching Solo Jazz
* Johan Selander (Sweden) & Maria Margot (Spain) teaching Lindy Hop 
* Lauren Smith & Peter Flahiff (US) teaching Balboa, Collegiate Shag & Lindy Hop

The teachers will each be working from a different venue, and you'll choose your own adventure on the weekend - check out the descriptions on the Classes page.

They are open level, but the teachers have been asked to treat the "floor" as intermediate, and the "ceiling" as advanced. Expect the Sunday classes to be more challenging than the Saturday ones.

The whiskey tasting is optional, but with very limited spaces. It's being ran by a local dancer, and will feature some of the most interesting options the island has to offer.

The t-shirt will be a completely unique design for year, also thanks to a local dancer. There's a unique design every year - collect them all!

Finally, here's the actual cost for the event.
