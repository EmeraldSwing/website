The Emerald Interlude is a small weekend swing dancing event in Dublin, Ireland. 

We’re a small and enthusiastic community that organises and promotes inclusive approaches to dancing on and off the floor.

Its first edition was September 2022, and returns this July 26th! It substitutes a bigger event called Emerald Swing for quieter years.

We're inviting back Johan Selandar & Maria Margot as teachers for the event, who taught during Emerald Swing 2023.

It will include 6 hours of core classes, 2 hours of tasters and 8 hours of social dancing. The classes will be Lindy Hop-focused and aimed at mixed levels.

The [Charlemont Community Resource Centre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gtBNtufm5ExnZkx97) will be the venue for the entire event.

Registration will be available through [DanceCloud](https://pobailstomp.dancecloud.com/) on March 29th.
