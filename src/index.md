Registration is now open for the 2023 edition of Emerald Swing! We are gradually refining how we present information, but here's the most pertinent details:

* The dates are October 20th-22nd
* The first activity is at 7PM on Friday, last class at 4PM on Sunday (Whiskey tasting ends around 7PM!)
* There is an early bird price available until the 22nd of September
* It's unlikely there will be single night passes due to venue capacity - determined after early bird
* You'll have eight hours of core classes, choosing between 24 options
* There'll be six hours of social dancing across two nights - we're trying to negotiate for two more hours
* Each night of social dancing will feature an hour taster class, a live band, and a special competition

Your teachers are as follows:

* Erol Akinci (Turkey) teaching Solo Jazz
* Johan Selander (Sweden) & Maria Margot (Spain) teaching Lindy Hop 
* Lauren Smith & Peter Flahiff (US) teaching Balboa, Collegiate Shag & Lindy Hop

The teachers will each be working from a different venue, and you'll choose your own adventure on the weekend - check out the descriptions on the Classes page.

They are "open" level, but the teachers have been asked to treat the "floor" as intermediate, and the "ceiling" as advanced. Expect the Sunday classes to be more challenging than the Saturday ones.

The whiskey tasting is entirely optional, but with very limited spaces. It's being lead by a local dancer, and will feature some of the most interesting options the island has to offer.

The t-shirt will be a completely unique design for year, also thanks to a local dancer. There may be more unique designs in future years - collect them all!

Finally, here's the actual cost for the event.


|  | Full Pass | Party Pass | Whiskey Tasting | T-Shirt
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Early Bird (Closing Sep. 22)** | €150 | €30 | €35 | €25
| **Final Price (Closing Oct. 15)** | €180 | €35 | €40 | €30

<!-- Hello, it's been a while! After a gauntlet of attempts to find a new venue, we're ecstatic to announce that the full Emerald Swing event will be coming back on the third weekend of October, the 20th to the 22nd!

There are still a few moving parts to settle, but we have a few details we can share at this point: you'll have ten hours of classes (Which include tasters!) and at least six hours of social dancing (We're hoping to negotiate 8-10 with the venue).

Most of the event will take place near the Blackpitts-Portobello edge of Dublin City Centre, and the classes themselves will be a la carte - we're having mixed level, topic-focused classes. When registering, you'll select eight of a possible twenty four classes to attend!

We're trying to make our updates as concise and informative as possible, so we intend to announce the teachers and open registration with our next update in as early in August as we possibly can.

It's still being configured, but we'll be making all announcements five days early over our e-mail newsletter - which could be an important factor for registration, if you're in a rush!

Those of you who attended The Emerald Interlude are already on the list of email recipients. Here is the link:

We look forward to welcoming you all back to Dublin! -->
