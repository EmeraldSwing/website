Hello, it's been a while! After a gauntlet of attempts to find a new venue, we're ecstatic to announce that the full Emerald Swing event will be coming back on the third weekend of October, the 20th to the 22nd!

There are still a few moving parts to settle, but we have a few details we can share at this point: you'll have ten hours of classes (Which include tasters!) and at least six hours of social dancing (We're hoping to negotiate 8-10 with the venue).

Most of the event will take place near the Blackpitts-Portobello edge of Dublin City Centre, and the classes themselves will be a la carte - we're having mixed level, topic-focused classes. When registering, you'll select eight of a possible twenty four classes to attend!

We're trying to make our updates as concise and informative as possible, so we intend to announce the teachers and open registration with our next update in as early in August as we possibly can.

It's still being configured, but we'll be making all announcements five days early over our e-mail newsletter - which could be an important factor for registration, if you're in a rush!

Those of you who attended The Emerald Interlude are already on the list of email recipients. Here is the link:

We look forward to welcoming you all back to Dublin!
