Registration is now open for the 2023 edition of Emerald Swing! We are gradually refining how we present information, but here's the most pertinent details:

* The dates are October 20th-22nd
* The first activity starts at 7PM on Friday and the last class ends at 4PM on Sunday (Whiskey tasting ends around 7PM!)
* There is an early bird price available until the 22nd of September
* It's unlikely there will be single night passes due to venue capacity - which will be determined after early bird
* The venue for social dancing is [Charlemont Community Resource Center](https://goo.gl/maps/7E5H43C6bFySdxDv8)
* It's also one of three venues being used for classes, all within a 15 minute walk - the others are [Dublin Studio](https://goo.gl/maps/rxi2trFkX5zAx4dn6) and [St Kevin's Community Centre](https://goo.gl/maps/6eqUigbpCgbXoHCH9)
* You'll have eight hours of core classes, choosing one of three classes for each hour
* Friday and Saturday night will start with an hour long taster class, followed by three hours of dancing
* Both nights will feature a mix of DJs, live music, and special competitions!

Your [teachers](/teachers) are as follows:

* Erol Akinci (Turkey) teaching Solo Jazz
* Johan Selander (Sweden) & Maria Margot (Spain) teaching Lindy Hop 
* Lauren Smith & Peter Flahiff (US) teaching Balboa, Collegiate Shag & Lindy Hop

The teachers will each stay in a single venue, and you'll choose your own adventure on the weekend - check out the descriptions on the [classes](/classes) page.

Classes are open level, but the teachers have been asked to treat the "floor" as intermediate, and the "ceiling" as advanced. Expect the Sunday classes to be more challenging than the Saturday ones.

The whiskey tasting is optional, and has very limited spaces. It's being ran by a local dancer, and will feature some of the most interesting options the island has to offer.

The t-shirt will have a completely unique design this year, also thanks to a local dancer. There's a unique design every year - collect them all!

Finally, here's the actual cost for the event.
